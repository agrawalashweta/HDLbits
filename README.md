# HDLbits
This is a  repository contains my solutions to problems from HDLbits , an online platform for learning digital logic design using Verilog HDL.
Link: https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Problem_sets
Solutions are grouped by the topic categories available on HDLbits.

These solutions are for educational purposes. If you are working through HDLbits yourself, do try to figure out the problem by yourself before jumping to the direct solutions. Contributions, improvements and suggestions are most welcome!
